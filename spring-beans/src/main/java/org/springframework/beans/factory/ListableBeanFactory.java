/**
 * Extension of the {@link BeanFactory} interface to be implemented by bean factories
 * that can enumerate all their bean instances, rather than attempting bean lookup
 * by name one by one as requested by clients. BeanFactory implementations that
 * preload all their bean definitions (such as XML-based factories) may implement
 * this interface.
 *
 * <p>If this is a {@link HierarchicalBeanFactory}, the return values will <i>not</i>
 * take any BeanFactory hierarchy into account, but will relate only to the beans
 * defined in the current factory. Use the {@link BeanFactoryUtils} helper class
 * to consider beans in ancestor factories too.
 *
 * <p>The methods in this interface will just respect bean definitions of this factory.
 * They will ignore any singleton beans that have been registered by other means like
 * {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory}'s
 * {@code registerSingleton} method, with the exception of
 * {@code getBeanNamesForType} and {@code getBeansOfType} which will check
 * such manually registered singletons too. Of course, BeanFactory's {@code getBean}
 * does allow transparent access to such special beans as well. However, in typical
 * scenarios, all beans will be defined by external bean definitions anyway, so most
 * applications don't need to worry about this differentiation.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> With the exception of {@code getBeanDefinitionCount}
 * and {@code containsBeanDefinition}, the methods in this interface
 * are not designed for frequent invocation. Implementations may be slow.

 * ListableBeanFactory：可将Bean逐一列出的工厂
 * 它提供了提供容器中bean迭代的功能,不再需要一个个bean地查找.比如可以一次获取全部的bean(太暴力了),根据类型获取bean等等。它的这个功能在Spirng内部有大量的应用
 * 注意：
 * 1.如果同时实现了HierarchicalBeanFactory,返回值不会考虑父类BeanFactory,只考虑当前factory定义的类.
 * 当然也可以使用BeanFactoryUtils辅助类来查找祖先工厂中的类。
 * 除了getBeanNamesOfType和getBeansOfType这两个方法，其余方法的逻辑都不会考虑父容器的Bean，只会考虑本容器自己的Bean
 * 2.getBeanDefinitionCount和containsBeanDefinition的实现方法因为效率比较低,还是不频繁使用为好.
 *
 * 这个工厂接口最大的特点就是可以列出工厂可以生产的所有实例。
 * 这个工厂作为二级接口，有多个独有的方法，扩展了BeanDefinition的功能，提供了BeanDefinition、BeanName、注解有关的各种操作
